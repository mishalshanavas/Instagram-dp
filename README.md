> **TL;DR**: Fork this repo, add your pics, set your credentials, and let GitHub change your Instagram DP every 3 hours. You'll look active while doing absolutely nothing.

## Quick Setup
```
1. Fork → 2. Upload pics → 3. Add secrets → 4. Chill
```

**Step 1: Fork This Thing**  
Hit that **Fork** button up there ↗️ You now own this bot.

**Step 2: Drop Your Pics**  
Put your images in `assets/images/`:
```
assets/images/
├── 1.png
├── 2.png 
└── ...
```
> Pro tip: Don't get fancy with names. The bot has trust issues.

**Step 3: Secret Stuff**  
**Settings** → **Secrets** → **Actions** → Add these:
- `INSTA_USER` → Your Instagram username  
- `INSTA_PASS` → Your Instagram password

**Step 4: Watch It Work**  
Bot runs every 3 hours (6:30 AM - 11:30 PM IST).  
**Impatient?** Force run: **Actions** → **Run workflow** → `force_run = true`

## How It Works

| What | When | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **Auto mode** | Every 3 hours | Set it and forget it |
| **Sleep mode** | 11:30 PM - 6:30 AM | Nobody changes DP at 3 AM |
| **Rate limit** | 3+ hour gaps | Instagram gets cranky otherwise |
| **Force mode** | Anytime you want | Because patience is overrated |

**Smart features:**
- Remembers where it left off • Skips if it just ran • Handles Instagram's mood swings • Keeps you logged in

## When Things Break

```bash
# Nothing happening? → Check Actions tab for red X's
# Login failed? → Double-check username/password  
# Rate limited? → Chill. Instagram will forgive you.
```

**That's it.** Fork → Setup → Netflix

**Built with** [instagrapi](https://github.com/adw0rd/instagrapi) - The unofficial Instagram API that actually works

*Don't blame us if Instagram gets moody* 🤷‍♂️
